Description:

This is the website of the documentation and the information for the College I read in. I generally created this in order to practise my code and also making it easy for my classmates to find any information. I ultimately made this just to practise my coding skills actually.


You can download or clone it if you want for free and Its also copyright free (maybe in the future idk)
