                            <h3>The Principal Of <span>Mirzapur Cadet College</span></h3>
                            <p>Mirzapur Cadet College, a scintillating name in the echelon of secondary and higher secondary education of the country, has been true to the thought and philosophy for which cadet colleges have been set. Being the third of its genre of twelve till date, this college has kept providing quality and class education to its students since the emergence in 1963 with a view to procreating all round citizens with widened vision and lofty mission. And this has solely been possible because this institution always cares for the all-out development both mental and physical of the cadets. The fact that our cadets are mentally sound and physically robust has catapulted them to the zenith of success wherever they are stationed. They have earned glory for their college by making excellent results in all public Examinations, by demonstrating extraordinary performances in different curricular and extra-curricular competitions at home and abroad, and afterwards by rendering fitful services nationally and globally. The salubrious ambience of the college, tinged with the college motto- ‘Knowledge is Power’ broadens the circumspection of the cadets and instills deep psychological insights. Here our teachers take immense pleasure in teaching the young learners and always preach moral sermons as befitting to their age levels to chisel the characters of our cadets so that the latter can be shaped into good human beings with envious personality, imbued with loyalty , self-respect and patriotism. We really feel proud that we have been part of such great institution that has already produced more than two thousand and five hundred cadets, fulfilling all its aims and objectives for the set-up of this institution. Finally I wish all the best to this renowned institution and earnestly request all the members of the college to work very hard and selflessly to make our ever-soaring journey smooth.</p>
